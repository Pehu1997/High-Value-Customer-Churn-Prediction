# High-Value-Customer-Churn-Prediction
# Overview: 
Churn prediction model focused on high-value customers using ML techniques like Random Forest, SMOTE.

# Objective:
Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the key factors contributing to customer churn within the context of LoyaltyVision Analytics, a customer-oriented business aiming to maximize customer retention and long-term value. The objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies potential churners using customer data, and to provide actionable insights for retention strategies. This study combines machine learning techniques with business analytics to enhance customer relationship management and decision-making.

# Key Steps
This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology to predict churn among high-value customers using machine learning and exploratory data analysis.

1. Business Understanding
Predict churn of high-value customers
Objective: Reduce revenue loss and improve customer retention strategies through predictive analytics.
2. Data Understanding
Loaded and explored the dataset containing customer details like revenue, tenure, service score, complaints, cashback usage, etc.
Identified target variable: Churn (1 = churned, 0 = retained).
3. Data Preparation
Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
Treated outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Performed label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Scaled numerical features and balanced the target variable using SMOTE.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate and bivariate analysis using histograms, bar plots, heatmaps, and boxplots.
Identified key churn indicators: low tenure, high complaints, low service scores.
5. Modeling
Trained and evaluated multiple models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost.
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Selected Random Forest as the best-performing model.
6. Evaluation
Compared models using Accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
Random Forest achieved highest scores:
Accuracy: 0.97
F1 Score: 0.91
ROC-AUC: 0.99
7. Insights & Recommendations
Target early-tenure customers with engagement programs.
Improve service quality and complaint resolution process.
Use cashback and loyalty strategies to retain valuable users.

# Future Enhancements
- Integrate with Power BI or Streamlit for dashboard deployment.
- Use real industry data for more robust validation.
- Deploy model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
